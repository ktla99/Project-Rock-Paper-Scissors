# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project was an arduous adventure that I had ever traversed through!

Going through the javascript portion was quite challenging, but the result was well worth the effort.
The HTML portion has becoming easier to work through as time passes.
The CSS portion has to be the most stimulating as it required a touch of artistic creativity which I personally thrive in.
